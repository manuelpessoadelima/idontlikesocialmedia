    <a href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/849689186">SkipAd</a>
   <p class="explanation">This work was a comission from Tectonics Festival and has to do with some ADs that 
    were poppingup all the time on my youtube  (until I installed an ad blocker). My algorithm was showing me that stuff; mostly finnancial advice, 
    how to get sucessful fast, etc. As a musician I always felt I was "opposing neoliberalism", but the free-lance life, even in an experimental context, 
    ends up in the same mesh. This work consists of an endless sequence of uplifting tones and positive affirmations, where the musician is trapped on an ad of itself.

    <a href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/789573704">Brazil Means Red</a>
    <p class="explanation">This was a lecture that I made in parallel to an article on experimentalism and whiteness. 
 I am trying to reflect a bit on my own background, my notion of "brazilian music" and also 
my own whiteness whithin it...I know there is a hype around the topic and that this seems oportunistic, but to me became also a existential problem, it is a genuine interest of mine.

<a href=https://simonekeller.bandcamp.com/track/manuel-pess-a-de-lima-from-memory>From Memory</a>
<p class="explanation">This is my latest musical release, composed by the swiss piano quartet Kukuruz and recorded at Stanford. 
  Here is the description of the piece: "I wrote each pianist a letter to be opened and read during the recording session. In the letter, I ask them to play or even practice some excerpts of pieces that were somehow emblematic of their formative years with the piano. This becomes the source material for a collage piece, where I process these fragments, creating multiple sonic layers of this collection of memories, intertwining the processed sounds with the unaltered recordings. Among improvised material, snippets of the following pieces appear: Study for Mixed Accents (Ruth Crawford), Prelude (Julia Perry), Sonata KV540 (Mozart), Guernica (Paul Dessau), Visions Fugitives (Prokofief), Chanson Pour L' auvegnat (Georges Brassens) and Pour Le Piano (Debussy). The collage wanders through hesitating gestures, in the pianist's attempt to recall the muscle memory of pieces they once learned. In this sense, the poetics of memory appears as what it forgets, and in its directionlessness, inaugurates another, actualized, memory."
