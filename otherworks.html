   <p class="explanation">This work was a comission from Tectonics Festival and has to do with some ADs that 
    were poppingup all the time on my youtube  (until I installed an ad blocker). My algorithm was showing me that stuff; mostly finnancial advice, 
    how to get sucessful fast, etc. As a musician I always felt I was "opposing neoliberalism", but the free-lance life, even in an experimental context, 
    ends up in the same mesh. This work consists of an endless sequence of uplifting tones and positive affirmations, where the musician is trapped on an ad of itself.

    <p class="explanation">This was a lecture that I made in parallel to an article on experimentalism and whiteness (published in portuguese). 
 I am trying to reflect a bit on my own background, my notion of "brazilian music" and also 
my own whiteness whithin it...I know there is a hype around the topic and that this seems oportunistic, but to me became also a existential problem, it is a genuine interest of mine.
