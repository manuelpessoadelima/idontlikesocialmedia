   <p class="explanation">This work was a comission from Tectonics Festival and has to do with some stuff that 
    was popping up all the time on my youtube ads (until I installed a ad blocker). It's a bit 
    embarassing that my algorithm was showing me that stuff; mostly finnancial advice, and 
    how to get sucessful fast. It was an attempt to create an ambigous strangeness, 
    a melancholic work with "uplifting music and positive messages"</p>

    <p class="explanation">This was a lecture that I made in parallel to an article on experimentalism and whiteness (published in portuguese). 
 I am trying to reflect a bit on my own background, my notion of "brazilian music" and also 
my own whiteness whithin it...I know there is a hype around the topic and that this seems oportunistic, but to me became also a existential problem, it is a genuine interest of mine.
